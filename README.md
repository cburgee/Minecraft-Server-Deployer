# Minecraft-Server-Deployer(Work-in-Progress)

## Description

This application will eventually be a website where users can launch their own minecraft dedicated servers. It is designed to connect non-tech individuals with the power of dedicated servers, without having to learn all of the technical bits. Ideally, I would like to create containerized Java minecraft servers hosted on Amazon Web Services'(AWS) Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS). I want to develop this app so I can connect non-tech individuals to normally tech-savvy functions and so I can earn passive income while I continue to search for permanent employment.
